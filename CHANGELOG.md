# Unreleased

Changed:

- Focus an available pane on launch, so that launch behavior follows typical use (e.g. if `dashboard.sidebar.default_action`
  is set to `replacePane`, then selecting a channel in the sidebar will replace the focused pane instead of opening a new pane)
- `hidden_server_messages` has been changed to `server_messages` and additional customization has been added:
  - Exclude messages [join, part, quit].
  - Adjust username format. 

Fixed:

- Accept '*' as a legal special symbol for usernames
- Handle ZNC 'username/server' style usernames

# 2023.3 (2023-07-27)

**Message history and dashboard state will be reset due to a breaking change. We've switched to a more flexible storage format 
to ensure future breakages won't occur.**

Added:

- Away-notify extension added for supported servers
- SASL support for PLAIN & EXTERNAL. The following per-server config keys have been added:
  - PLAIN - `sasl.plain.username` & `sasl.plain.password`

- Configuration option `buffer.hidden_server_messages` to hide server messages from the provided array of sources: ["join", "part", "quit"]

- Upon joining a channel, display the channel mode in the buffer
- When querying an away user, you will see an away message
- Autocomplete on joined channels

Changed:

- Away users will be appear slightly transparent in nicklist
- Configuration option `new_buffer` has been renamed to `buffer`. `new_buffer` key will still work for backwards compatibility.

Fixed:

- Changes done in the config file are now properly applied to the old buffers
- Text and colors on light themes will no longer appear washed out
- All WHOIS responses are now properly routed to the buffer where the request was made (text input or via context menu)
- Accessing text input history will only populate the current buffer, not all of them
- Text from input box can be copied to clipboard
