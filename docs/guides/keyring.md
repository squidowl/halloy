# Storing Passwords in the System Keyring

The system keyring keeps passwords out of your configuration file.

Set a keyring option to `true`:

```toml
[servers.liberachat]
password_keyring = true
```

If the entry is missing, Halloy asks for the password. Halloy then saves it in
the system keyring.

Use only one source for each password. For example, do not set both `password`
and `password_keyring`.

## Entry names

The value `true` uses an automatic entry name. You can use your own name
instead:

```toml
[servers.liberachat]
password_keyring = "my-irc-password"
```

## System support

Halloy uses these system stores:

- macOS Keychain
- Windows Credential Manager
- Secret Service on Linux and FreeBSD

On Windows, entry names are not case-sensitive.

To replace a saved password, remove it from the system store. Halloy asks for
it again when the configuration is loaded.

### Access in Flatpak

To access keyrings while running in Flatpak, you will need to manually grant your install of
Halloy access to the system keyring. You can do this by running:


```bash
flatpak override org.squidowl.halloy --talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets --user
```

If Halloy Flatpak is installed to the system rather than user:

```bash
sudo flatpak override org.squidowl.halloy --talk-name=org.freedesktop.secrets --system
```
