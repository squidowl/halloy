### Build from source

Clone the Halloy GitHub repository into a directory of your choice and build with cargo.

Requirements:

* [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/)
* Packages:
  - Fedora-based distributions: `alsa-lib-devel openssl-devel libxcb-devel`
  - Debian-based distributions: `librust-alsa-sys-dev libssl-dev libxcb1-dev`

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/squidowl/halloy.git

cd halloy

# Build and run
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

#### Install from Source

The script `install-linux.sh` in the `scripts` directory of the Halloy repository will build and install Halloy on Linux systems (with the same requirements as building from source).  By default the script will install Halloy in the `~/.local/` base directory (i.e. the executable will be put in `~/.local/bin/`).  To change the installation base directory, provide `install-linux.sh` with the long flag <nobr>`--prefix=<base/directory>`</nobr>.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/squidowl/halloy.git

cd halloy

./scripts/install-linux.sh --prefix=<base/directory>
```
